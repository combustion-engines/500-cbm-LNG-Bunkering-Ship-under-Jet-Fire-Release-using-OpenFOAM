# 500-cbm-LNG-Bunkering-Ship-under-Jet-Fire-Release-using-OpenFOAM
This study investigates the impact of a jet fire release on personnel safety and the structural integrity of an LNG bunkering ship in a port scenario. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using OpenFOAM solver model immediate fire ignition to predict temperature distributions within the vessel’s structure.
